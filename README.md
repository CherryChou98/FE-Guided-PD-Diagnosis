# FE-Guided-PD-Diagnosis


This work entitled "Facial Expression Guided Diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s
Disease via High-quality Data Augmentation" has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM). 

In this package, we implement our PD diagnosis model using Pytorch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


To train the diagnosis model and get the evaluation results, you can run the following command:
```bash
$ python train.py --batch_size 32 --optimizer adam --lr 1e-3 --weight_decay 1e-5 --epochs 70
```
To get the quality scores which are results of facial image quality assessment (FIQA), you can use ```calc_quality_scores.py```.
